BeagleCar
=========

Self driving car powered by the BeagleBone Black and a cheap RC car. Herein lay
 the brains, test-code, and other random development detritus involved in the 
making of my senior project.

Read about this project on my 
[website](http://andrewdai.co/beaglecar/intro.html)

Besides the short tests in `src/test/` everything is built on top of
[ROS](http://ros.org).

This project utilizes Adafruit's BBIO Library.
